- Handle `errors.Wrap(err, fmt.Sprintf("foobar"))`
- Better arg parsing (look for files recursively)
- Better exported api from processor (maybe set of files to process?)
- Errors better at telling you where the issue is
- Walk through all files
- Can we assert/check that err is not nil?
- Handle Unwrap?
- Use Is() instead of Cause() ?
